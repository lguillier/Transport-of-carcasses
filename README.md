# Transport-of-carcasses

Data on the core and surface temperature evolution during cooling and transportation collected in different slaughterhouses were used to predict core and surface temperatures. Temperature profiles and predictive microbiology models were then associated to simulate the growth of *E. coli*, *Pseudomonas*, *Salmonella* and *Listeria monocytogenes* on the rind and meat surfaces of the carcasses. These simulations, based on the surface temperature, took also into account the variability related to the pH and water activity of the carcasses as well as the strain variability related to the microbial behavior.

This repository provided Matlab codes and datasets.
